# SmartHire AI

SmartHire AI is an AI-powered recruitment support system designed to help recruiters
quickly understand candidate profiles by analyzing resumes and public technical data.
The goal of this project is to reduce manual screening effort and enable more
data-driven hiring decisions.

This project was developed as part of my academic and practical learning in
Artificial Intelligence and Data Science.

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Recruiters often spend a significant amount of time manually reviewing resumes,
checking GitHub profiles, and evaluating candidate skills. This process is time-consuming,
error-prone, and difficult to scale.

SmartHire AI aims to assist recruiters by:
- Extracting useful information from resumes
- Analyzing candidate technical skills
- Providing structured insights instead of raw data

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

SmartHire AI acts as a decision-support tool that:
- Accepts candidate input through a web interface
- Processes resumes and technical data
- Applies machine learning models for skill understanding
- Generates recruiter-friendly insights and reports

The system does **not replace recruiters**, but helps them make faster and more informed decisions.
