# SmartHire AI 🤖

SmartHire AI is a **personal AI-powered recruiter and career assistant** designed to help
candidates understand their professional profile, strengths, and career direction.

Instead of acting as a traditional ATS or resume parser, SmartHire AI behaves like a
**virtual recruiter** that guides users through resume analysis, skill evaluation,
career recommendations, interview preparation, and interactive AI support.

This project demonstrates how artificial intelligence can be used to create
**human-centric career guidance systems**.
